# slox
compiler in scala for the programming language lox.
It is mostly based on craftinginterpreters.com and also a bit on Ronald Mak his Writing compilers and interpreters 

## Lox
Lox is the programming language from the site craftinginterpreters.com, see http://craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html
I will try to stick with the steps and programming language from that site.
Making it more in a functional way, is another challenge for me.

## Scala
Why Scala you might ask. The craftinginterpreters.com starts with Java. To add functional programming to it, I decided to start with Scala.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to learn how Compilers work and to enhance my Scala skills.

### about me
Java programmer by day, other programming languages by early morning.
